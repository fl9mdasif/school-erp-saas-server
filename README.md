## 2. Quick start

Requirements: Node 22+, a MongoDB **replica set** (transactions need one: Atlas works, or use the compose file below).

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # then fill it in, see Configuration
npm install
npm run seed:plans          # starter / standard / large
npm run seed:admin          # platform owner from SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL / SUPER_ADMIN_PASS
npm run dev                 # http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health
```

With Docker (API plus a one-node MongoDB replica set):

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec api node -e "console.log('up')"
```

Useful commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start with reload (tsx watch) |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Compile to `dist/` and run it |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit`, strict mode |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm test` | Whole test suite (in-memory MongoDB replica set, no setup needed) |
| `RUN_PERF=1 npx vitest run tests/perf.test.ts` | Opt-in performance gates |
| `npm run docs:api` | Regenerate `docs/openapi.json` |
| `npm run smoke` | Post-restore sanity check against `DATABASE_URL` |
| `npm run seed:plans`, `npm run seed:admin` | Idempotent seeds |

## 3. Configuration

All configuration is environment variables, validated with Zod at boot. The process refuses to start on an invalid environment. Tests never read `.env`.

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV` | no | `development` (default), `test`, `production` |
| `PORT` | no | Default `5000` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | MongoDB replica set URI |
| `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` | yes | At least 16 characters; use 48 random bytes in production |
| `JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN` | no | Default `15m`. Keep it short: a long value delays role changes |
| `JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN` | no | Default `7d` for staff. Students and guardians are fixed at 30 days |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SUPER_ADMIN_PASS` | for seeding | Password must be 12+ characters in production |
| `PLATFORM_NAME`, `PLATFORM_DOMAIN` | no | The product name and domain are placeholders, never hard coded |
| `RESERVED_SLUGS` | no | Extra reserved school slugs, comma separated |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | no | Dashboard origins allowed with credentials |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | no | Defaults to true in production |
| `UPLOAD_PROVIDER` | no | `mock` (default) or `cloudinary` |
| `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` | with Cloudinary | Secret stays on the server |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | no | Error reporting is off without it |
| `PUBLIC_CACHE_TTL_MS` | no | Public lookup cache, default 15000. `0` disables |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | pino level |

`BCRYPT_SALT_ROUND` in older `.env` files is ignored: passwords use argon2id.

## 4. Architecture

```
Client ──> Express 5
            ├─ requestId          (AsyncLocalStorage context starts here)
            ├─ pino-http, helmet, rate limits, CORS, JSON 1 MB, sanitize
            ├─ authenticate()     tenant comes ONLY from the JWT
            ├─ roleGuard(...)     then ownership checks in services
            ├─ validateRequest()  Zod on body, query, params (unknown keys rejected)
            └─ controller ─> service ─> Mongoose model (tenantScoped plugin)
```

### 4.1 Multi-tenancy (the invariant everything else depends on)

- Every tenant-owned collection has a required `tenantId`, injected by the `tenantScoped` plugin.
- The active tenant lives in an `AsyncLocalStorage` context. Authenticated requests get it from the verified JWT; public requests get it from the `:slug` path segment. A `tenantId` in a body, query or path on an authenticated route is rejected.
- **A query with no tenant context throws.** The only escape is `.unscoped()` / `runUnscoped()`, allowed in platform, auth, tenant, audit, public and job code only. A test scans the source and fails the build if it appears anywhere else.
- `bulkWrite` bypasses model middleware, so `scopedBulkWrite` injects the tenant by hand.
- Platform-level collections (`Plan`, `Tenant`, `PlatformAdmin`, `RefreshToken`, `SubscriptionPayment`) are listed explicitly in `PLATFORM_MODELS`; a test fails if any other model lacks `tenantId`.
- A cross-tenant attack suite replays tenant A's token against tenant B's ids on every route family.

### 4.2 Identity and sessions

- Login is `tenantSlug + identifier (email, phone or student ID) + password`. Wrong slug, wrong password and inactive user return the same generic error, with a timing-equalising dummy hash.
- Access JWT (short), refresh token in an httpOnly SameSite=Lax cookie scoped to `/api/v1/auth`, stored hashed, **rotated on every use**. Presenting an already-used token revokes the whole family. Two parallel refreshes cannot both win (atomic claim).
- Student and guardian access is always filtered to linked student ids on the server. Teacher scope is derived from `ClassSubject.teacherId` and `Section.classTeacherId`, never from a client-supplied list.
- Suspended tenants: non-admin users are blocked, the admin gets read-only access plus billing, and the public site and published result lookup **stay online**.

### 4.3 Money

- Amounts are integer poisha (1 BDT = 100 poisha). Percent discounts round half up, only there.
- `LedgerEntry` is append-only: update and delete throw at the model layer. Corrections are new reversal entries.
- Every multi-document write is a MongoDB transaction. Payments update the invoice with a single conditional pipeline update (`dueAmount >= amount`), so two simultaneous payments can never overpay.
- Invoice generation and payments require an `Idempotency-Key` header; a repeat returns the original result. A second invoice for the same student, session, period and fee heads is skipped and reported.
- Online gateways are out of scope; the `Payment` shape already carries `provider`, `providerRef` and `idempotencyKey` for a later adapter.
- A nightly job (`ledgerConsistency`, 02:00 Asia/Dhaka) recomputes every invoice from the ledger and logs any mismatch.

### 4.4 Results

- The grading engine (`result.engine.ts`) is a **pure function**: no database, no clock. All rules (pass percent, component pass marks, absent handling, grace marks, fourth-subject bonus, merit tie-break) come from the grading scale document, so a rule correction is a config change, not a deploy.
- Mark states: `draft` -> `submitted` (teacher locked, admin can unlock) -> `locked` (after publish). Results: `draft` -> `published` (immutable).
- Publish refuses incomplete marks unless `forceMissingAsAbsent`, recalculates, then locks one class per transaction. Safe to retry.
- Post-publish changes go through the **correction** route only: reason required, version bumped, class re-ranked, audit entry with before and after.
- Public lookup returns one generic "No result found" for a wrong roll, a wrong birth date or an unpublished exam, is rate limited per IP and per school, sends `Cache-Control: no-store`, and exposes no phone, address, guardian or birth registration data.

### 4.5 Files

Nothing is uploaded through the API. The browser uploads directly to Cloudinary using a short-lived signed request from `POST /uploads/sign` (tenant-scoped folder, image formats whitelisted). Stored links must belong to this platform's Cloudinary account, so a client cannot save a link to an arbitrary host.

### 4.6 PDFs

Receipts and marksheets use `pdfkit` with Noto Sans Bengali embedded (`assets/fonts`) for Bangla shaping. The HTML receipt is printable as a fallback.

## 5. Domain modules

Each module lives in `src/app/modules/<name>/`. Complex modules follow the six-file shape (`controller`, `service`, `model`, `interface`, `route`, `validation`); simple lookup tables use the shared `crudRouter` factory in `src/app/lib/crud.ts`.

| Area | Modules |
|---|---|
| Platform | `platform`, `plan`, `tenant`, `slug`, `auditLog`, `counter` |
| Identity | `auth`, `user` |
| Academic | `academicSession`, `class`, `section`, `subject`, `classSubject`, `student`, `guardian`, `enrolment`, `studentImport`, `promotion` |
| Daily operations | `attendance`, `notice`, `publicSite`, `staffProfile`, `inquiry`, `upload`, `publicApi`, `dashboard` |
| Money | `feeHead`, `feeStructure`, `feeAdjustment`, `invoice`, `payment`, `ledger`, `receipt`, `feeReport` |
| Exams | `gradingScale`, `exam`, `marks`, `result`, `marksheet`, `publicResult` |

To add a module: create the folder, add its model to `src/app/models.ts` (so the isolation guards see it), mount its router in `src/app/routes/index.ts`, and add tests. Use `createTenantSchema` for tenant data; it applies tenant scoping, soft delete and audit stamping.

## 6. API conventions

- Base path `/api/v1`. Success: `{ success: true, data, meta? }`. Error: `{ success: false, code, message, details? }`. Clients localise by `code`.
- Lists paginate with `page` (default 1) and `limit` (default 20, max 100) and return `meta: { page, limit, total }`.
- Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` in Asia/Dhaka; timestamps are UTC ISO strings. Phone numbers are normalised to `01XXXXXXXXX`.
- `POST /payments` and `POST /invoices/generate` need `Idempotency-Key` (8 to 100 characters). `POST /invoices/generate?dryRun=true` and `POST /students/promote?dryRun=true` preview without writing.
- `POST /auth/refresh` needs the `X-Requested-With` header (CSRF guard) plus the cookie.
- Interactive docs: import `docs/openapi.json` into any OpenAPI viewer. It lists 76 operations with request schemas, allowed roles and the idempotency header, and is regenerated by `npm run docs:api`.

Roles: `superAdmin` (platform console only), `admin`, `teacher`, `accountant`, `student`, `guardian`. The full permission matrix is PRD section 4 and is enforced by `roleGuard` plus ownership checks in services.

## 7. Testing

The suite runs against an **in-memory MongoDB replica set** (`mongodb-memory-server`), so transactions are exercised for real and no database setup is needed. Every test file gets its own database. The tenant isolation checks are a required CI check.

| Layer | Files | What is proven |
|---|---|---|
| Pure logic | `resultEngine`, `libs`, `slug` | GPA table, component pass marks, absent, grace, fourth subject bonus, 5.00 cap, rounding, merit ranking with shared positions, money rounding, Dhaka dates, slug rules. Expected values are hand checked |
| Tenant isolation | `plugins`, `isolation.guard`, `isolation.attack` | Query without context throws; reads, writes, aggregates and `insertMany` are scoped; `.unscoped()` only where allowed; every model is tenant scoped or listed as platform; cross-tenant attacks on users, money, exams and public results fail |
| Identity | `auth.*`, `users`, `platform` | Atomic signup, reserved and duplicate slugs, generic login errors, lockout, refresh rotation and reuse detection, CSRF header, password reset, last-admin guard, suspension rules |
| Academic and daily ops | `academic`, `students`, `studentImport`, `promotion`, `attendance`, `notices`, `publicSite`, `dashboard` | Plan cap, atomic student ids under concurrency, CSV dry run and idempotent commit, promotion preview equals commit, edit windows, audience rules, honeypot, published gate |
| Money | `fees` | Idempotent generation, adjustments, overpayment rejected, simultaneous payments never overpay, reversal restores dues, ledger append-only, ledger consistency job, collection report equals payments minus reversals, Bangla PDF receipt |
| Exams | `exams` | Marks entry scoping, submit and unlock, publish lock, retry safety, audited correction with re-ranking, generic public failures, `no-store` |
| Uploads | `upload` | Cloudinary signature recomputed and verified, tenant folder, account-scoped URLs |
| Performance (opt-in) | `perf` | 2,000 students x 12 subjects publish time and public lookup latency |

```bash
npm test                                          # everything except the opt-in performance gate
npx vitest run tests/fees.test.ts                 # one file
RUN_PERF=1 npx vitest run tests/perf.test.ts      # performance gates
```

**Latest full run** (typecheck, lint, audit, tests): `tsc` clean, ESLint clean, `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities, **27 test files passed, 151 tests passed**, 1 opt-in performance test skipped. About 3.5 minutes on a laptop.

Performance gates (opt-in, in-memory MongoDB, so a staging run is the real proof): publishing 2,000 students x 12 subjects took **13.9 s** against the 30 s target. The public result lookup target is p95 under 500 ms; one run measured 832 ms but it overlapped with the full test suite, so treat that number as unconfirmed and re-measure on staging.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs typecheck, lint, the full suite and `npm audit --audit-level=high` on every push and pull request.

## 8. Security

Summarised here; the full review with the rate-limit table is in [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).

- argon2id, generic login errors, lockout, rotating refresh tokens stored hashed, httpOnly cookies, CSRF header.
- Zod on every route, Mongo operator keys stripped, 1 MB JSON limit, 5 MB and 2,000 row CSV limit.
- Tenant isolation enforced in the data layer and covered by an attack suite.
- Logs carry request id, tenant id and user id only; passwords, tokens, phone numbers and birth registration numbers are redacted.
- Secrets live in the environment only. `.env` is git ignored. Rotate any secret that was ever pasted into a chat or committed.

## 9. Operations

**Deploy.** `docker compose up -d --build` runs the API and a one-node MongoDB replica set. `docker compose --profile proxy up -d` adds Caddy for automatic HTTPS (edit `deploy/Caddyfile` first). For production prefer a managed MongoDB (Atlas replica set) over the bundled container, set `NODE_ENV=production`, and keep the API behind one reverse proxy (`trust proxy` is 1).

**Backups.** `ops/backup.sh` writes a gzipped `mongodump`, optionally encrypted with AES-256 (`BACKUP_PASSPHRASE`), keeps 14 days, and can push off-box through `BACKUP_UPLOAD_CMD`. Schedule it with cron. `ops/restore.sh <file> <target uri>` restores into a clean database and runs `npm run smoke` (collections present, ledger consistent). Run the restore drill monthly and log it. Requires the MongoDB Database Tools on the host.

**Observability.** pino JSON logs, `/api/v1/health` (liveness plus DB ping, no tenant data) for an uptime monitor, optional Sentry via `SENTRY_DSN` (ids only, no personal data), nightly ledger consistency check.

**Results day.** Public lookup is rate limited and cached for 15 seconds at the tenant level. Cached rows are cleared on every write that affects them.

## 10. Decisions and deviations from the PRD

| Topic | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| SMS and custom domains (PRD phase 6) | Not built | No paid SMS provider; custom domains not needed. The related plan feature flag and platform fields remain harmless |
| Online payments | Not built | Manual collection only in v1, per the PRD. Gateway adapters are v2 |
| Password hashing | argon2id | PRD wins over the `BCRYPT_SALT_ROUND` found in the first `.env` |
| File uploads | Browser to Cloudinary, signed by the API | Free plan is enough and no file bytes pass through the server |
| Background jobs | `node-cron` in process | No Redis to run. One job today (ledger check); move to a queue before adding SMS |
| Owner password rule | 12+ characters in production only | A short dev password must not stop the server booting locally |
| Simple CRUD modules | Shared `crudRouter` factory | Avoids six near-identical files per lookup table |
| Mongoose typing | Models without an interface use `Model<any>` | Mongoose 9 inference was unusable for the dynamic tenant schemas; behaviour is covered by tests instead |

## 11. Known limitations and launch checklist

Limitations to be aware of:

- Madrasa division names and grading rules are starting presets and must be reviewed with a real madrasa teacher. School rules follow the common Bangladesh GPA 5.00 approach and must be confirmed with two or three teachers before the first paying school.
- Bangla PDFs use embedded Noto Sans Bengali and are generated through `pdfkit`. The tests prove valid PDFs are produced; **open one real receipt and one 12-subject marksheet and check conjunct letters visually** before launch.
- Attendance holidays are not modelled (a date is simply not submitted).
- Email delivery has no provider: the forgot-password link is logged in development only. Connect an `EmailProvider` before relying on it.
- The cache and the cron job are per process. Run one API instance, or move both to shared infrastructure before scaling out.
- Backup, restore and Docker files are written and reviewed but need a first real run on the target host.

Before launch (owner tasks):

- [ ] Fill production `.env` with new random secrets; set `UPLOAD_PROVIDER=cloudinary` and the three Cloudinary values.
- [ ] Deploy staging, run the opt-in performance gates against it, then production.
- [ ] Do one backup and one restore drill; schedule `ops/backup.sh`.
- [ ] Add uptime monitoring on `/api/v1/health` and set `SENTRY_DSN`.
- [ ] Write the privacy policy and terms; check current Bangladesh data protection rules (students are minors).
- [ ] Pilot with two real schools for a week.

```

Conventions: TypeScript strict; the tenant key is always `tenantId` (never `schoolId`); money is integer poisha; business dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` strings; errors are `AppError` with a stable `code`; every state-changing admin action writes an audit entry. Commit messages follow `phase X.Y: what changed` for the build history and conventional prefixes (`fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `build:`) for follow-ups.
